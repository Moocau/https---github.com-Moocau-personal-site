I am very pleased to have finally completed the basic bones of this personal web-site. The biggest challenges I found was in the design and layout of the site. I have worked hard to try to bring out the creativity and find a design that matches my interests and displays it in a professional and clean method.

The inspiration for the site comes from cyberpunk styled media such as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Metal Gear Solid to name a few. The background images come from Stable Diffusion models pulled from openart.ai. 

Next steps are to style for mobile browsers and add a secret cow level (moo)!
