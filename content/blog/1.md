It has been just over a month since I completed the 12 week immersive full time program at Code Chrysalis. To say that it has been all sugar and rainbows since graduation would be a lie, but I feel confident I am on the right path in life to end up where I want to be.

While I was in the program I viewed it as a serious challenge to learn so much information in such a short period of time, my stress levels peaked during projects and I was sleeping very little.  However, when I look back on the experience I realise that I view my time there fondly. I met some wonderfully supportive people, learned more than I could have imagined and learned a lot more about myself in the process.

Even though the job market for junior roles is a bit dry, I am keeping my head up and focusing on the goal I had set all along which is to get out there and show the world what I am made of.
