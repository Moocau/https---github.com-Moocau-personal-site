The job hunt has been a struggle, however I have worked hard to keep my mentality focused on the end goal. I have managed to acquire one client to build their website (coming soon to a web near you).

I have recently been attending a fair few tech meetups around Japan and I must say, the community has been one of the most welcoming and wonderful I have had the pleasure of meeting. Everyone has such varied backgrounds and are so willing to help eachother out. From one of these meetups I may have found myself an opportunity to gain experience through an internship. I am so excited for this opportunity not only because of the doors it will help open but because I get to learn along side two friends I met at Code Chrysalis.

Here's hoping for a bright future ahead!
